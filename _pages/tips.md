How to use the Gallery Extension
--------------------------------
We support third party shape libraries to extend shape templates. Currenty the extension for supporting [Excalidraw Libraries](https://libraries.excalidraw.com/) is already bundled with the application. Use the following instructions to install the libraries. If you encountered any issues, please report them [here](https://github.com/flywheelapp/flywheel/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE). Once a library is installed, you can drag its components into your document.
