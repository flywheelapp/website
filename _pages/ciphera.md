Ciphera
--------
Ciphera is a simple app for text encryption and decryption. The encrypted text can be easily shared through the built-in share sheet.

The app leverages Apple's CryptoKit framework, utilizing the AES-GCM algorithm for robust encryption. The password for encryption is automatically generated at random for added convenience and security.
