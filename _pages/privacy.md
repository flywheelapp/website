Privacy Policy
==============
Effective Date: February 16, 2025

Flywheel ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how the App handles user data.

### **1. Limited Data Storage via iCloud**
The App may store data in your personal iCloud account to enable synchronization across your devices. This data remains private and is only accessible by you. The developer has no access to this data.

#### **What Data is Stored in iCloud?**
Depending on the App’s functionality, the following types of data may be stored in iCloud:
- User-generated content (e.g., documents, notes, or settings)
- Preferences or configurations related to the App
- Other app-specific data required for synchronization

### **2. Apple’s Role in iCloud Storage**
Since iCloud is a service provided by Apple, your data stored in iCloud is subject to Apple’s **iCloud Terms and Privacy Policy**. You can review Apple’s policies at:
[https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)

### **3. User Control Over Data**
You have full control over the data stored in iCloud. You can:
- Disable iCloud storage for the App via **System Settings > Apple Account > iCloud**.
- Delete app data stored in iCloud by managing your storage under **System Settings > Apple Account > iCloud**.

### **4. No Developer Access**
As the developer, I have no access to any user data, usage information, or personal details. The App does not include analytics, tracking, or logging features.

### **5. No Data Transmission**
Aside from iCloud synchronization, the App does not send any data over the internet to external servers or third parties.

### **6. Changes to This Policy**
If any updates are made to this Privacy Policy, the revised policy will be available within the App or on its official website.

### **7. Contact**
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach out to wilson.zh@outlook.com.

By using the App, you acknowledge that your data is stored in your iCloud account under Apple’s policies and is not accessible to the developer.
